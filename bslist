# Adapted from <https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/399701/70614>.  
#
# Changes made in this copy:  
#  - Added this leading comment block.  
#  - Indented code blocks by two spaces per scope level, not four.  
#  - Made a few minor comment wording and formatting tweaks and/or fixes.  
#  - To the `sed` script used to process `launchctl print`'s output:  
#    - Moved it into a single-quoted string spanning multiple lines.  (Note that, when consuming a script, `sed` ignores leading and trailing lines that are empty or consist solely of whitespace.)  
#    - Moved all comments in-line.  
#    - In the third comment:  
#      - Clarified that the 'ports' filtered out are Mach inter-process communication (IPC) ports.  
#    - In non-comment line 3:  
#      - From the first nested sub-expression in the expression on said line:  
#        - Removed the '|' ('or' operator.)  `sed` would interpret it as a literal '|' ('pipe' character) instead (see note below;) _that's_ not what I want.  
#
#          (Note:  `sed` treats any regular expressions you pass it as 'basic' — that is, non-'extendd' — by default.  For more details, consult `man re_format`.)  
#        - Add 'I' to also look and account for any possible registered-but-inactive services.  
#
# Usage:  
#
#   bslist
#
#      A 'quick and dirty' substitute for the obsoleted `launchctl bslist`.  Prints out a list of all `launchd` (Mach) services registered with your system's (Mach IPC) bootstrap service.  When invoked as the root user (presumably via `sudo`,) this command prints this list with respect to the `system` domain.  When invoked as a non-privileged user — that is, not the root user —, prints this list with respect to that current user account's per-user domain.  

if [ $(id -u) -eq 0 ]; then
  domain=system
else
  domain="user/$(id -u)"

launchctl print $domain | sed -e '
  # Remove all output before `endpoints = {`:  
  1,/endpoints = {/d
  # Remove all output after `}`:  
  /}/,$d
  # Remove (Mach IPC) port information and format the output the same way `launchctl bslist` used to:

# PLibUDTU

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is PLibUDTU, my **P**ersonal **Lib**rary of **U**seful **D**evelopment **T**ools and **U**tilities.  You'll likely notice that it's currently quite sparsely populated.  I intend to add to this repository over time as I find bits and pieces of software and/or scripts that come in handy.  

## Licensing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I eventually intend to give this repository an open-source license, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.  In the meantime, feel free to borrow whatever you want from what's here, but I'd _really_ appreciate it if you left an attribution notice somewhere in or near whatever you save (a) local copy/-ies of.  Thanks in advance, and happy coding!
